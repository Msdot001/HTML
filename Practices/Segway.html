            Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
            through some interesting places on the way:

        <ol>                                             <!--List element used to provide inform in a list manner-->

            I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side      <!--use <blockquote> if you want to quote something that was a paragraph or more-->

            I definitely won’t be passing any cars.

        My first day of the trip! I can’t believe              <!--<q> help to marking up short quotes in HTML documents-->
        finally got everything packed and ready to go.         <!--use <q> anytime you just want to throw in a quote as part of your running text.-->  
        Because I’m on a Segway, I wasn’t able to bring        <!--the <q> element is an inline element-->
        a whole lot with me:
       </p>
       <ul>
            <li>cell phone</li>
            <li>iPod</li> 
            <li>digital camera</li>                   
            <li>a protein bar</li>
            
       </ul>

       <p> Just the essentials.As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a                         
        thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
