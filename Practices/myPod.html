        <p>
            Welcome to the place to show off your iPod, wherever you might be.
            Wanna join the fun? All you need is any iPod from the early classic
            iPod to the latest iPod Nano, the smallest iPod Shuffle to the largest
            iPod Video, and a digital camera. Just take a snapshot of your iPod in
            your favorite location and we'll be glad to post it on myPod. So, what
            are you waiting for?
        </p>
